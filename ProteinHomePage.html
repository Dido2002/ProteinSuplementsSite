                        <p>Pick your liquid. 
                            Sure, you could boil your chicken in water but that seems kind of boring, right? Boil your chicken in chicken broth is how to instantly up the flavor. 
                            Season it. 
                            Bring it to a boil. 
                            Once you have all of your flavors added, bring your water to a boil. Cover the pot and lower the heat slightly so it stays at a pretty rapid simmer. Depending on the size of your chicken breasts, they should simmer for about 10 minutes. After 10 minutes remove one piece from the pot and check. The internal temperature should be 165°. If they need more time check every 5 minutes. Don't let them overcook or they will become rubbery. 
                            Shred it up. 
                            After removing your chicken from the pot let it rest about 10 minutes. This will make them cool enough to shred and help keep some of the moisture in so that they don't dry out. Use two forks to shred your chicken or slice it up.</p>

                        <p>Combine leftover turkey leg, thigh, and breast meat in a stockpot over high heat; add chicken broth and onion. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover. Simmer, flipping turkey pieces over halfway, until meat falls off the bone, about 1 hour.
                            Transfer turkey pieces to a bowl and let cool until safe to handle.
                            Meanwhile, bring broth to a boil and stir in rice. Season with black pepper, cayenne, and salt. Reduce heat to medium and let rice simmer until it starts to plump up, about 10 minutes.
                            Pick turkey meat off the bone and chop into small pieces. Stir into the rice, adding more broth as needed. Cook over medium-low heat until rice reaches desired tenderness, 10 to 15 minutes.
                            Smash green onions, red pepper, and cilantro together for the salsa. Taste and season turkey rice as desired, then scoop into serving bowls and top with salsa.</p>
